# spec-mirror-clickhouse-cloud

A git mirror of ClickHouse Cloud's [OpenAPI spec](https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1), served by the API itself. The spec is fetched and committed as a JSON file so the repo serves as a versioned snapshot.

The mirror is updated every 24 hours and is designed to be used as a stable git submodule.

## Usage as a submodule

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/distilled-mirror/spec-mirror-clickhouse-cloud.git
```

## Updating specs

From `.meta/`:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run fetch-specs
```
